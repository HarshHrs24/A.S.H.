<!-- Approach -->
## Our Approach
Our approach to building an intelligent chatbot using the OpenAI GPT-3.5 Turbo model involves harnessing the power of real-life experiences from seniors to assist junior students. However, we recognize the challenges posed by the token limits of the model when dealing with a vast array of experiences. To overcome this challenge, we have implemented a structured approach involving MongoDB and two instances of the GPT-3.5.Turbo model:

### MongoDB Database for Experience Collection:
We have set up a MongoDB database to systematically collect and organize various experiences shared by seniors into different categories.
Each category corresponds to a specific area of concern for junior students, such as academics, study strategies, career advice, time management, extracurricular activities, and personal development.
Within the database, we maintain separate collections for each category to efficiently manage and access relevant experiences.

### First Model Instance - Query Executor:
The first instance of our chatbot model is responsible for handling user queries and retrieving relevant experiences from the MongoDB database.
When a junior student poses a question or seeks guidance, this instance executes a MongoDB query tailored to the specific category of the question (e.g., subject-related queries).
The query retrieves pertinent experiences stored in the corresponding collection, ensuring that the responses are closely aligned with the user's query.

### Second Model Instance - Experience Enhancement:
The second instance of our model comes into play after the first instance has retrieved relevant experiences.
Its primary role is to further refine the responses based on the real-life experiences of seniors.
It takes the retrieved experiences as input and fine-tunes its responses to provide more contextually accurate and valuable guidance to the junior student.
This fine-tuning process is crucial in tailoring the chatbot's responses to the specific nuances and details of the user's query.
By implementing this structured approach with two GPT-3.5.Turbo model's instances, we aim to provide junior students with comprehensive and contextually relevant guidance. The first instance efficiently retrieves relevant experiences from the MongoDB database, while the second instance enhances these responses, taking into account the valuable insights and context shared by seniors. This combined approach ensures that our chatbot can deliver high-quality assistance to junior students, facilitating their academic and personal growth effectively.
